Lam_search_MATLAB Executable (Windows)

1. Download and install the Windows version of the MATLAB Runtime for R2016b (MATLAB Runtime 9.1) 
from the following link on the MathWorks website:
http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html
NOTE: You will need administrator rights to run the MATLAB Runtime installer. 

2. Download and run the Lam_search_MATLAB Executable as administrator (right click on the icon - run as administrator). The graphical interface opens.
NOTE: Initial opening might take up to 30 seconds. Once open, the application runs much quicker.

3. Enter inputs (e.g. material, ply thickness, component, failure criterion, etc.).
NOTE: Random load generator generates 44 additional load cases where each stress component is between the upper and lower bounds of the stresses of the 5 main loads.
NOTE: Control load is the load case (main or random) where the best double-double (DD) laminate has the lowest reserve factor (R value).

4. Press 'Calculate' and see the results appear.
